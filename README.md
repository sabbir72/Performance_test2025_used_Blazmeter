🗓 Test Execution Details
Tester: Sabbir Ahamed

Date: May 12, 2025

Time: 3:51 PM – 4:01 PM

Duration: 9 minutes (actual test activity: ~8 minutes)

Location: West India (Mumbai, Azure)

Testing Tool: JMeter

Scenario Name: Blaz_Rec2025

Max Virtual Users (VU): 50

📊 Key Performance Metrics
Metric	Value	Notes
Average Response Time	723.38 ms	Time taken for complete response
90% Response Time	1787 ms	90% of requests responded within this time
Average Throughput	2.55 hits/sec	Number of requests served per second
Average Bandwidth	24.48 KiB/s	Data transferred per second
Error Rate	0%	No errors during test

🔍 Detailed Observations (Request Stats)
Each endpoint or step in the test was measured:

All pages had consistent response times between 400–600 ms.

Peak response time for a specific scenario reached up to 1808 ms (avg) and 1978 ms (95th percentile).

No errors occurred during any of the requests.

⚙️ System Resource Usage
CPU & Memory Usage: Stayed well below 75% during the test.

Connections & Network I/O: Stable and within acceptable limits.

🧠 Glossary (Important Terms)
Throughput: Requests handled per second.

Response Time: Time to get full response.

Latency: Time to receive first byte from the server.

🧾 Conclusion (Summarized)
The system handled 50 virtual users smoothly.

Performance was solid: most responses under 1 second.

No errors, indicating good stability.

Suitable for small to medium traffic loads.



💡 Overall Verdict: GOOD
Your load test results indicate a healthy, stable system under medium load (50 virtual users). Here's a breakdown:

📌 Positive Indicators
Metric	Result	Standard Benchmark	Evaluation
Average Response Time	723 ms	Ideal: < 1000 ms	✅ Good – Fast response
90% Response Time	1787 ms	Ideal: < 2000 ms	✅ Acceptable – Within limits
Error Rate	0%	Ideal: < 1%	✅ Excellent – No failures
Throughput	2.55 hits/sec	Depends on app	✅ Healthy flow
CPU/Memory	< 75% usage	Ideal: < 80%	✅ Stable under load

⚠️ Minor Considerations
The 90th percentile response time (1787 ms) is a bit high compared to the average, which indicates that some requests took much longer than others. This is not bad, but it’s worth watching if the load increases.

🚀 What This Means
Your site or app can handle real-world user traffic (~50 users simultaneously) without crashing or slowing down drastically.

This test would be considered a pass for small to mid-sized web applications or APIs.

🟢 Conclusion:
Performance is good. No errors, fast average response times, and stable resources. You are ready for real-world moderate usage. To go further, consider testing with 100+ users or simulating peak-hour scenarios.
